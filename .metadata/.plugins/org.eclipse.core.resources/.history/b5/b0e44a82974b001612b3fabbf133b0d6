/*
 *  22A. 
 *   One algorithm that you could use would be to iterate through the characters of the smaller integer, beginning in the ones place,
 *   and to add the larger integer to itself that many of times, holding this summation in a temporary variable. Then as you iterate to the tens
 *   place and above, you add the appropriate number of zeros to the end of the this temporary number to get the correct scale multiplication. Then
 *   you use a separate accumulator to sum these temporary numbers themselves, which are created for each character of the smaller integer. This
 *   accumulator, after iterating through the entire smaller number, will give you the correct answer to the product of two large integers. This
 *   is the algorithm that I will implement for the multiplication of large integers.This works relatively similarly to the addition algorithm, 
 *   as described in the book.
 *  
 *  22B. I implement the multiply method in the LargeInt class which is located in the largeints package.
 *  
 *  22C. I added multiplication to the driver application, as seen below.
