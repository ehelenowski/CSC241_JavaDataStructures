/*
 *  22A. One algorithm that you could use would be to take the smaller number and multiply each element of it to the larger number and then keep track of
 *  the result of each multiplication. You can use an accumulator to sum up each of the multiplications and hence, you will have the answer. This works 
 *  relatively similarly to the addition algorithm, as described in the book.
 *  
 *  22B. I implement the multiply method in the LargeInt class which is located in the largeints package.
 *  
 *  22C. I added multiplication to the driver application, as seen below.
