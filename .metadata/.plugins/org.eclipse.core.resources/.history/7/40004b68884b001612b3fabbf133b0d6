/*
 *  22A. One algorithm you could implement to multiply two large integers would be to do an element wise multiplication and keep track of the carried values,
 *  adding the carry values to the next byte slot, similar to how the carry works when adding digits as shown in the book. The multiplication can work very
 *  similarly to the addition algorithm. This way would be consistent with the teaching of the book and makes a lot of sense to implement in this fashion, 
 *  as such, this is the way in which I will implement the multiply method of the large integer class.
 *  
 *  22B. I implement the multiply method in the LargeInt class which is located in the largeints package.
 *  
 *  22C. I added multiplication to the app, as seen below.
